### Hi!

I am a professional problem solver with over 10 years of experience. I have extensive expertise in managing and leading large international teams, both on-site and remotely. My background in science equips me with a unique perspective for tackling complex challenges. With a strong foundation in mathematics and logic, I often come up with out-of-the-box ideas while ensuring simplicity and clarity.

My greatest strengthâ€”and perhaps my biggest challengeâ€”is that I remain open-minded at all times.

Currently, I collaborate with Sofomo (Poland) and several tech companies worldwide, with a primary focus on various backend and machine learning technologies.
