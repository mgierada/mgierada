- ðŸ”­ Working on [TGSE](https://github.com/mgierada/sgu_transcript_generator) an English based audio files to text converter and search engine that ensures that grammar, casing and punctuation are on the spot. An efficient search engine allows users to define a text-based query and play an audio file from the exact location where the query occurs. Among others, it's a unique tool for podcating as it makes feel you are searching through audio files like you do through texts. Currently applied to the Skeptic's Guide to the Universe Podcast.
- ðŸ”­ Working on [RWTP](https://github.com/oMG-technologies/RWTP) a REST API for getting translation of random English words to a language of choice together with the correct pronunciation. The core of the API is open for external collaborators. Additional features including users, registration, authorization, etc. are included in the [FlashCard](https://github.com/oMG-technologies/Flashcards) project.
